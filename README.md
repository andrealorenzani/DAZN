# Solution

## Tech stack
This project has been done with NodeJS, although it is my second (small) project with that language. The technology stack used is the following:
 * *swagger-tools 0.10.1* for generating the server from the swagger definition
 * *uuid 3.3.2* to generate a v1 UUID as id
 * *loki-js 1.5.5* an in-memory database
 * *tap 12.0.1* as a test suite

Obviously **swagger-tools** imports a big amount of other libraries. I don't know most of them. Please refer to the **Swagger generated server** section of the documentation for reading the (autogenerated part of the) documentation

## Implementation
The service has 3 REST API:
 * *POST /stream/${userId}* to create a new stream, returning a `streamId`
 * *PUT /stream/${userId}/${streamId}* to *keep alive* the stream (as a default a stream is alive for 30 seconds)
 * *PUT /stream/${userId}/${streamId}* to delete a stream

The server has an autogenerated frontend based on SWAGGER. From there you can test the server and you can also retrieve the `CURL` commands to invoke it from a command line.
To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:9000/docs
```

## Scalability strategy
Please consider that, using an in-memory not clustered database, the scalability strategy may be complex (as usual when a service is not *stateless* - we required that a user always hit the same instance). The second increment of the development would be to add an external database, I indeed started to code a second dao (not finished yet - my tests are broken so I didn't push them) based on **MongoDB**.

This would make really easy to increase the performances: the service is already containerized (with *docker* - please refer to the section at the end of the README) and MongoDB is easy to deploy and scale. At that point with the normal tools of a cloud system, it would be easy also to autoscale the service when needed.

## Future increments
I am fully conscious that the solution has a lack in the persistence: not only for the db (inmemory, as said it makes the service not scalable), but also because the proposed solution does not make use of `Promises` that, although maybe not necessary with an inmemory db, would have been a requirement for substituting the database with a decoupled one. 

# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:9000/docs
```

This project leverages the [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

# Docker
### How to build

In the main directory, use this command:

```
sudo docker build -t <user>/dazn .
```

### How to push

Login with docker command line
```
docker login --username=<user> --email=<email>
```

Tag your image (you can see tag and name with `docker images`)
```
docker tag <image-id> <user>/dazn:latest
```

Push the image
```
docker push <user>/dazn:latest
```

### How to run

Be sure you have the docker image
```
docker pull alorenzani/dazn
```

Run it
```
docker run -p 9000:9000 alorenzani/dazn
```
